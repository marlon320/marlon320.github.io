            <pre> Meeting 1:
                1/21/2020
                Amikumu as possible or forum post
                No typing in english type in cherokee or phonetic cherokee
                Push notification if people are near eachother to initiate conversation
                Text channel can open so they can find eachother
                Prompt can be asked to achieve some task, get something introducing talking about likes and dislikes.
                Could assign giving roles of customer and service provider at start of the game or friend even for friendly conversation.
                Could include certain prompts
                Overarching goal is to create conversation in a public setting/social domain.
                AR can be thrown out.
                Could includie beginning indepentend studies within the game that add points
                Phrase should be items you can get system can remind you of phrases you already know. Get phrases as like some sort of spell you can use in conversation using the phrase in a real conversation coul unlock an achievement 
                Cherokee android plugin
                https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=klye.plugin.ck&hl=en_US
                Single person event where you can ask someone who may not speak cherokee and try to achieve a task while speaking cherokee for points. Not optimal user should seek others to help learn to build their skills and the cherokee language community
                Should have a leveling system starting with benning things like listen and repeat and can then ask users to do more advanced things
                After the two person event would happen assessing methods can be done by having higher level players help lower levels more. 
                Not bringing in people who don’t want to learn cherokee and focusing more on those interested.
                 


                
                Meeting 2:
                Client happy with the direction of the game. 
                Discussed different versions of the home page.
                Recieved funny phrases and responsed.
                Got access to Clients sakai practice problems.



                Meeting 3 2/6/2020
                Fill in the blank apples to apple style questions are good forms for comfortability, can open up to regular type anything. Players could hit a help button to get a starter phrase to use if they show
                PWA/PWD- Progressive web app/dev. Only pulls content as you need it, apple is way behind but apple and android both agreed to support it. Makes a web app look like a native app.
                Phone gap/Cordova. Lots of types to do ios/android compatibility
                The camera is a nice addition, we can have a hardware/software workaround by screenshotting the screen from the camera instead of triggering the camera. Put in design doc as stretch goals. Put in (not a primary goal)
                Concern, if too many people play the game, the game will look too cluttered. Show it later so the client can see and decide how it looks
                For multiplayer connectivity, firebase is the likely option, look at options for connectivity over Bluetooth or the same wifi. Bluetooth is the worst option of these. Microsoft will give nonprofits credits as a “donation” for free API usage.
                Start sketching out how things will look like. Helpful for planning 
                Add development pot with links to what we are using as programming language, APIs SDKs etc.

               
               
               
                Meeting 4 2/13/2020
                Include a picture in profile, Cherokee skill level(rank). Self-proclaimed Cherokee proficiency. Maybe move leaderboard. Ask ben about whether default or phonetic can be used. Lean towards defaulting in phonetic due to background screen being phonetic.

                Question for Ben
                - Is it possible that without knowing the meaning of the word we can do a phonetic translation of the word
                -for home screen training or learning?
                2n rounds up until a certain point then 1n.
                Sprints
                1 week goal is setting up firebase database
                Start with database and multiplayer, lobby and database profile and join.
                2nd- game with entering question responding voting winner round(s) score
                3rd. Rounds  themes and hints
                4th. Location service training leveling 
                5th- camera
                Lobby and game are distinct but connected. Lobby phase first then launch the game. Any user can be able to create a lobby and name it in order to distinguish lobbies. Go from play to the option of hosting or joining a lobby, lobby host can then start the game when other users join.
                Be able to add in profile contact information but keep it optional.
                Make sure people speak their answers two votes, one for best answer second for how well they said it
